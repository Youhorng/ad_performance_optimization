    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current digital marketing work, businesses allocate a lot of budgests to online advertising across many social media platforms to attract potential customers into buying certain products that they are intentionally trying to show through the ads. However, a common and costly challenge is the inefficient targeting of users as ads are often served to individuals with low or no intent to engage, which can lead to wasted effort, poor return on ad spend, and reduce campaign performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the business needs a predictive system that can analyze user data and contextual signals to determine the likelihood of an ad being clicked or not, which we also can improve the ad performance later on by deploying ads to specific customer segments so that we can have high return on ad spend, increasing businesses' branding and revenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Project Objectives**\n",
    "1. **Develop a supervised machine learning model:** We aim to build a classification model that can predict whether certain users will click the ad or not, so that the businesses can target the right users, potentially converting them to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate actionable business insights:** This project aims to explore the raw dataset, and creating new features that can add valuable insights to the analysis to guide businesses or marketing team to target the right users to click the ad. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build customer segmentations:** We want to identify distinct group of users on their behavior on clicking the ad or not so that we can also use this as one of the features to predict whether they will click the ad together with another features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Project Implementation**\n",
    "In order to build an effective and robust machine learning model, these are the steps that we can follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Understanding:** Explore the data source, types of features, and understand the meaning of each column. Gain an overview of the dataset and the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, inconsistent data types, and outliers. Ensure data quality before analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize distributions, detect patterns, trends, and correlations. Identify potential biases or imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new relevant features, apply transformation, and prepare the features to be ready for modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Build customer segmentation:** Use clustering to segment users based on features to understand different user types and personalize ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Business insights:** Derive actionable insights such as high-conversion user groups, ad formats with higher engagement. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Development:** In this step, it can include multiple steps such as:\n",
    "    - **Data Preparation:** Normalize/scale features, split data into training, validation, and testing sets, address class imbalance.\n",
    "    - **Model Training:** Train various classification models, tune hyperparameters, and use cross-validation.\n",
    "    - **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate using metrics.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. **Conclusion:** Summarize findings, best-performing model, business implications, limitations, and suggest next steps."
