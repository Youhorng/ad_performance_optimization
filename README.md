# Predictive Ad Click-Through Model

## Introduction
In the digital marketing landscape, businesses allocate significant budgets to online advertising across various social media platforms to attract potential customers and drive product sales. However, a common challenge is the inefficient targeting of users, where ads are often shown to individuals with low or no intent to engage. This leads to wasted efforts, poor return on ad spend, and reduced campaign performance.

This project aims to solve this issue by developing a predictive system that analyzes user data and contextual signals to determine the likelihood of an ad being clicked. By targeting the right customer segments, businesses can improve ad performance, increase return on ad spend, and enhance their branding and revenue potential.

## Project Objectives
- **Develop a Supervised Machine Learning Model**: Build a classification model that predicts whether users will click an ad, allowing businesses to target the right users and potentially convert them into customers.
- **Generate Actionable Business Insights**: Analyze the raw dataset and create new features that add value to the analysis. The goal is to help businesses or marketing teams identify the right audience to target for better ad click-through rates.

## Project Implementation

### 1. Data Understanding
- Explore the data source to understand the types of features available and the meaning of each column.
- Gain an overview of the dataset, including feature distributions and potential imbalances.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types to ensure data quality.
- Address outliers and prepare the data for further analysis and modeling.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize feature distributions, detect patterns, trends, and correlations.
- Identify potential biases or imbalances within the dataset to guide model development.

### 4. Model Development
#### a. Data Preparation
- Normalize/scale features to bring them to a consistent scale.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Address class imbalance through techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

#### b. Model Training
- Train classification model with Logistic Regression.
- Tune hyperparameters and perform cross-validation to improve model performance.

#### c. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model using relevant metrics.
- Select the best-performing model based on its ability to predict whether a user will click on an ad.

## Conclusion
This project will provide businesses with a machine learning-based solution to efficiently target users for online ads, improving the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns and optimizing return on ad spend.
